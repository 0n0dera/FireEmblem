******************* TODO LIST ***********************

(DONE) Create window/init SDL
(DONE) Create background and implement scrolling
(DONE) Create sprite atlas and find sprite dimensions, set class constants to represent these dimensions
(DONE) Create Character class -> Player class
(DONE) Create array to hold characters, only draw the characters that the camera sees 
	   (have vector of players/enemies and iterate through)
(DONE) re-implement flood fill for grid map
		- think about boundaries: check if floodfill is going out of bounds
		- check if impassible terrain (an enemy counts as impassable terrain)
(DONE) Fix up game states input handling (up down left right handlers)

- be able to loop through attackable enemies with arrow keys
- add row to player sprite sheet for grey, draw player grey states,
- use player counter to track nongrey players. If player counter == 0 or player_phase_done_ (menu option), enemy turn
- when enemy turn done, set player counter to vector size and player_phase_done_ false
- work on attacking!
